“Story of the Time when Gods were everywhere”
Art Attraction Installation
A multi-media art attraction installation used symbol/character and the most advanced digital technologies to ethically engage the audience. As the symbols on the screen are touched by children, they evolve into the images that they represent. As more images are created by this tactile function, a story begins to emerge. Design of the installation in way works when children touch the characters the world contained in those characters opens up and the story begins. The objects that are born from the characters influence each other and are influenced by children`s actions. Children using their bodies and changing the world together can create a story. The objects that emerge from the symbols influence one another and are influenced by the actions of other people. For example, a bird lands on a tree, a sheep runs away from a dog, and a sheep dances as a child approaches it.

Interaction: The most interesting thing about the project is the interactivity and its reliance on audience participation. As spectators touch using finger point onto the wall to see the projected content, characters the world contained in those characters opens up and the story begins

a. Timeline/Schedule






b. Audit

Review existing work and product: “Story of the Time when Gods were everywhere” 


1. Replacement      In the current education system, from a young age and without exception, the focus is on homogeneous development of individual ability, so that each individual has no weak points. Homework is done individually, tests are taken individually and entrance examinations are individually evaluated. In other words, working solo is completely drilled into students.
But in society, it is increasingly required to be able to achieve creative results as part of a team. Collaborative and creative experience, in other words “co-creative” experiences, that is what we believe children may need now more than anything else.

2. Other technology

Using the latest digital technology, we want children to enjoy moving their bodies about freely in a shared space, interacting with each other, collaboratively creating in a “co-creative” experience. And we want them to become the kind of people who can enjoy creative collaboration
